Organic Chemistry: Functional Groups
Functional groups are specific arrangements of atoms within organic molecules that determine the molecule's properties and reactivity. Major functional groups include alcohols (R-OH), aldehydes (R-CHO), ketones (R-CO-R'), carboxylic acids (R-COOH), esters (R-COOR'), amines (R-NH2), and ethers (R-O-R'). Each group exhibits characteristic chemical reactions that form the foundation of organic synthesis pathways.

Introduction to Quantum Computing
Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics principles to process information in ways classical computers cannot. Unlike classical bits, quantum bits or qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Quantum computers excel at specific problems like factoring large numbers and simulating quantum systems. Key concepts include quantum gates, entanglement, and quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's algorithms.
