Organic Chemistry: Functional Groups
Functional groups are specific arrangements of atoms within organic molecules that determine the molecule's properties and reactivity. Major functional groups include alcohols (R-OH), aldehydes (R-CHO), ketones (R-CO-R'), carboxylic acids (R-COOH), esters (R-COOR'), amines (R-NH2), and ethers (R-O-R'). Each group exhibits characteristic chemical reactions that form the foundation of organic synthesis pathways.

Introduction to Quantum Computing
Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics principles to process information in ways classical computers cannot. Unlike classical bits, quantum bits or qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Quantum computers excel at specific problems like factoring large numbers and simulating quantum systems. Key concepts include quantum gates, entanglement, and quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's algorithms.

Between 1900 and 1945, Indonesia experienced significant historical changes that shaped the nation's path to independence. At the beginning of the 20th century, Indonesia was still under Dutch colonial rule, known at the time as the Dutch East Indies. In 1901, the Dutch introduced the Ethical Policy, which aimed to improve the welfare of the indigenous people through education, irrigation, and migration. However, this policy did little to change the core of colonial exploitation. Instead, it unintentionally led to the rise of an educated class that would become the foundation of Indonesia's nationalist movement. The spirit of nationalism began to emerge strongly in the early 1900s. In 1908, Boedi Oetomo was established by Javanese students and is considered the first native political organization. This was followed by the formation of Sarekat Islam in 1912, which united Muslims and merchants across the archipelago. That same year, the Indische Partij was formed as the first political party to openly demand independence. Indonesian students studying abroad in the Netherlands formed the Perhimpunan Indonesia in the 1920s, promoting nationalist ideas on the international stage. One of the most important moments in the nationalist movement was the Youth Pledge (Sumpah Pemuda) on October 28, 1928. At this congress, young Indonesian activists declared their unity in one motherland, one nation, and one language: Indonesia. This moment became a powerful symbol of national identity and unity beyond ethnic and regional differences. Despite the growing nationalist movement, the Dutch responded with repression. Many nationalist leaders such as Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, and Sutan Sjahrir were arrested or exiled. Nevertheless, political movements like the Indonesian National Party (PNI) continued to spread the call for independence. During World War II, Japan invaded and occupied Indonesia from 1942 to 1945, expelling the Dutch. The Japanese occupation was harsh and exploitative, but it also contributed to the growth of nationalism. Indonesian leaders were given more political space and opportunities, and organizations such as PETA trained young Indonesians in military skills. The use of the Indonesian language was encouraged, helping to strengthen national unity. After Japan's defeat in 1945, the opportunity for independence finally arrived. On August 17, 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaimed Indonesia’s independence. This marked the beginning of a new chapter, though the struggle was not over, as the Dutch tried to re-establish control, leading to the Indonesian National Revolution that lasted until full recognition of independence in 1949. Key figures during this period include Sukarno, the leader of the independence movement and later Indonesia’s first president; Mohammad Hatta, the first vice president; Ki Hajar Dewantara, a pioneer in education and national awareness; and Kartini, a symbol of women’s empowerment and education. The period from 1900 to 1945 was one of awakening, struggle, and transformation that laid the foundation for the Republic of Indonesia.
